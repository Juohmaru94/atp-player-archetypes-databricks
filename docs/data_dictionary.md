# Data Dictionary

## Source Files

- `atp_matches_2020.csv` to `atp_matches_2024.csv` — ATP tour-level main-draw match data for analysis

## Notes

- `fact_player_match` will be the main base table for analysis.
- This table will later feed player-level aggregation, clustering features, and winning-driver analysis.
- Rankings data will not be separately integrated in v1 unless needed later.

## Raw Source Schema Notes

### Match files
- Match files contain winner-side and loser-side fields in a denormalized structure.
- Rankings and ranking points are already included in the match files.
- Player performance stats are available separately for winner and loser.

### Player file
- `atp_players.csv` is a reference table with player-level biographical fields.
- It can be used to validate or enrich player identity fields later if needed.
